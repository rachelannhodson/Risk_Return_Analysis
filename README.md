# Risk Return Analysis

A data analyst would need their personalized `.csv` file which contains closing prices for stocks along with the `risk_return_analysis.ipynb` file. This file will allow the analyst to inspect their stock closing prices in many different ways. They will also be able to create plots analyzing the different stocks against each other or against a control stock such as the S&P 500. An analyst would use this information to determine which equities to add to their portfolio or which to recommend to their clients.
