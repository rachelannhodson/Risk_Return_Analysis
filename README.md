# Risk Return Analysis, Module 4 Challenge

A data analyst would need their personalized csv file which contains closing prices for stocks along with the `risk_return_analysis.ipynb` file. This file will allow the DA to inspect their stock closing prices in many different ways. They will also be able to create plots analyzing the different stocks against each other or against a control stock such as the S&P 500. A DA would use this information to determine which equities to add to their portfolio or which to recommend to their clients.

then JupyterLab will automatically open in your browswer. Use the left side menu bar to search for the `risk_return_analysis.ipynb` file. Open this file. Add your personalized CSV files with the data you'd like to anaylze to either the same folder OR you should know what folder they're in on your local computer so that you'll be able to access them within the program. Then you can read your CSV files and use any of the provided code to anaylize the files in order to get the resulting information that you need.
